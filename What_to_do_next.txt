On auction create
  Default auction
    current_bid should match item starting price //
    bidder_id should be the original owner //

    Problems created:
      If no one bids, the original owner should not ---------
        be able to win the auction

Bid on auction
  Must have payment detail to bid //

User Sign Up
  Must add verification

View Payment History
  This page needs to be made. It is the last //
    unfinished page.

Billing Infos
  There is no way to edit a billing info for a payment
    detail. No way to create one, or remove one. Right
    now it's like they don't exist.

Items
  There is no way to edit an Item after it has been //
    created. Should be possible if the auction has
    not started yet.

Pages that break if no items/auctions exist:

Home page
  Needs auction to work  //
    Just put in a default option if there is no
      auction currently

Auctions
  Does not break, BUT there is nothing saying 	//
    "No auctions currently"
    In Past OR Future (need both)

View My Auctions 				//
  Needs auction to work
    Should just display a page with
      "No auctions currently"

Admin Auctions  //
  Needs flagged auction to work
    Should just display a page with
      "No auctions currently"

Pages that have user issues:

My Account
  Tries to load even when user not logged in
  Admin cannot access this page (because no payment
    details).
    Admin should be able to access this page.

View My Auctions
  If a user is not logged in, it will break
    Should just redirect to home page

Other stuff to do:

Go through the use cases, and make sure that they all work.
  At each step in the use case, take alternative paths:
    Just do something different, or that should
      break the system.
    Be really thorough. This is boring, but it finds
    bugs. (This is black box testing).

Go through the tables as a user. See a page you
  shouldn't be able to see? Fix it.
    For instance /items is not supposed to be
    visible to ANYONE. Why can both the user and admin
    reach it?
    (Don't change the routes file to fix these).
